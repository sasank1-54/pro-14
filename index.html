        <p>Information is stimuli that has meaning in some context for its receiver. When information is entered into and stored in a computer, it is generally referred to as data. After processing -- such as formatting and printing -- output data can again be perceived as information. When information is compiled or used to better understand something or 
            to do something, it becomes knowledge.</p>
